title: Parson's Problems

# What is a Parson’s Problem? 
A Parson’s Problem is a task in which learners are given all of the blocks or lines of code needed to solve a problem. The lines of code, though, have been jumbled so that they are no longer in the correct order. Learners are asked to reorganise the code into the correct order to perform a specific task. 
# Benefits
The main benefit of Parson’s Problems is that the learner is focusing on the structure and logic of blocks of code, rather than on the syntax of individual text elements (the ‘atoms’ of the Block Model). The process reduces the cognitive load experienced by learners, allowing them to practise sequencing and problem-solving with code. This experience is particularly helpful in the early stages of learning to program, when learners may be easily frustrated and put off by repeated unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem. Parson’s Problems also expose learners to logic and syntax that they may not be fully familiar with.
